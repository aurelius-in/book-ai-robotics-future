# 1. Introduction to AI in Robotics

## 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI systems can be broadly categorized into two types: narrow AI and general AI.

### Narrow AI

Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed and trained for a specific task. Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation algorithms used by Netflix and Amazon, and self-driving cars are examples of narrow AI. These systems are highly specialized and cannot perform tasks outside their designated functions.

### General AI

General AI, or strong AI, refers to a system with generalized cognitive abilities. It can learn, understand, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. General AI remains largely theoretical and is a major goal of ongoing AI research.

### Key Components of AI

1. **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. ML algorithms improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.
   
2. **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. It is particularly effective in processing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images and natural language.
   
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability of a computer to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP is used in applications like chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
   
4. **Computer Vision:** The ability of a computer to interpret and make decisions based on visual inputs. This technology is used in facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles.

### The Role of AI in Robotics

In robotics, AI plays a crucial role in enabling robots to perform complex tasks autonomously. By integrating AI, robots can:
